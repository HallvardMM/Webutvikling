        <h2>The Artist</h2>
        <p>
            The artist was born in Eastern Norway. In his childhood years he was not very interested in computers or the
            arts. He did play videogames on his computer in his teenage years, like many teenagers from the same era,
            <br> but did not take any interest in programming before he decided that he wanted to study computers at
            univerity level.
            He learnt his programming skills at the prestigious university NTNU in the
            Masterâ€™s degree programme for <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mtdt" target="_blank">Computer
                Science</a>.
            <br>
            During his first and second year at the univerity he did not really try web development, but he was lucky
            and
            landed a internship during the summmer between the second and third year where he tried some web
            development.
            <br>He liked what he learnt during the summer and decided to explore the land of front end and decided to
            take part in the class "IT2810 - Webutvikling".
            <br>This class challenged the artist and he had to make two similar paintings with the web technology "SVG"
            and "Canvas". This exhibition is the result of this challenge.
