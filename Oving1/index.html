        <h2>About the art installation</h2>

        <p>
            This is a project designed to express the artist's love for interactive web art.
            The artist's hope is that humanity will achieve world peace through this challenging and expressive
            art
            installation.
            <br>
            Please feel free to enjoy the works <b>"Two SVG Houses"</b> or <b>"Two Canvas Houses"</b> which you can find
            the
            link to in the top of this page. The artist has tried to challenge himself by creating the same motive and
            same interactions using two different web technologies.
            If you feel extra motivated, you will also find information about the artist as well.
            <br>
            In the bottom of the page you will find a button which will reveal some documentation about the
            project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enjoy!
        </p>
